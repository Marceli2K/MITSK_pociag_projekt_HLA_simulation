# MITSK_pociag_projekt_HLA_simulation

Train simulator based on the Portico library.

Train - checking tickets and taking seats. The train travels through a set number of stations and has a set number of seats. At each station passengers get on the train and take seats (if available) in compartments (the car has a fixed number of compartments). Conductors walk around the train. They check whether the passengers have tickets (the time of ticket checking is given). What is the probability that a passenger stowed away. And what is the probability that a passenger will occupy a seat.
